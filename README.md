## What is IT Academy?
[IT Academy](https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/en/itacademy) is a project from [Barcelona Activa](https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/en/home) that aims to train and develop new digital talents for the growing IT market in Barcelona. It has four main curriculums: Front-End, Back-End, Data-Science, and Full-Stack.

When I arrived in Barcelona I was looking for a Data-Science course and that's how I found out about this project. Meanwhile, I was studying other online courses and I started to wander toward a more programming career than a data science career, so I decided to take on the Java Back-End itinerary.

## Main Itinerary: Java & Spring Framework <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg/300px-Java_programming_language_logo.svg.png" alt="Java" height="50"/> <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework#/media/File:Spring_Framework_Logo_2018.svg" alt="Spring" height="50"/>
