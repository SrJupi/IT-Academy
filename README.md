[IT Academy](https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/en/itacademy) is a project from Barcelona Activa that aims to train and develop new digital talents for the growing IT market in Barcelona. It has four main curriculums: Front-End, Back-End, Data-Science, and Full-Stack.

When I arrived in Barcelona I was looking for a Data-Science course and that's how I found out about this project. Meanwhile, I was studying other online courses and I started to wander toward a more programming career than a data science career, so I decided to take on the Java Back-End itinerary.

## My projects:
### Java & Spring Framework

### Hackaton
